# DAY - 2 DATA TYPES, NUMBERS, OPERATIONS,TYPE CONVERSIONS, F-STRINGS

# PYTHON PRIMITVE DATA TYPE

print(len("123456"))
print("HELLO"[4])
print("HELLO"[-1])

#STRING
print("123" + "345")

# INTEGER = WHOLE NUMBER
print(123 + 345)

# LARGE INTEGER 1,000,000 JUST AS MONEY USAGE
print(123,456,789) # it will give us space between number
print(123_456_789) # replace comma with underscore it will not print space

# FLOAT = FLOATING POINT NUMBER
print(3.14159)

#BOOLEAN
print(True)
print(False)

# TYPE ERROR, TYPE CHECKING AND TYPE CONVERSION

name = len(str(12345)) # without double coded still we use it as string
print(name) # and we know len() work in only string data type

print(int("123") + int("456"))

# only one blank line you can live in code after last line of code

# for check out data type - type()
print(type("Hello")) # print() must required to check out type()

print(type(1234))
print(type(True))
print(type(3.123))

# MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS IN PYTHON

# PEMDAS
# CODE WILL READ IN THIS WAY
# ( Parentheses , Exponents,Multiplication/Division,Addition/Subtraction )
print("My age:" + str(12))
print(123 + 456)
print(7-3)
print(3*2)
print(6/3) # it will print as <class 'float'>
print(6//3) # it will print as <class 'int'>
print(2**2) #it is 2  power 2 type operator (Exponents Operator )

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
score = 0
# [ += , -= , *= , /= ]
score = score + 1 # we can written this in one more way with assignment operator
score += 1
print(score)

# NUMBER MANIPULATION AND F STRINGS IN PYTHON

# round() it will give nearby value
print(round(3.9)) # it will print 4

# USE OF F STRINGS
# From use of set of curly braces we can use variable value live into string

marks= 0
height =1.0
is_winning = True
print(f"Your marks is = {marks}, your height is {height}. You are winning is {is_winning}")
